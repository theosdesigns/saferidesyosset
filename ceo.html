<h1><left>CEO</left></h1>
<br />
<p>Joshua Lafazan became one of the youngest elected officials in the history of New York State when at 18 years of age he was elected to the Syosset School Board of Education, receiving 82% of the vote in May of 2012. At the time of the election, Joshua was Senior Class President, graduating from Syosset High School in June of 2012. He is currently a sophomore in the Honors Program at Nassau Community College, and will be graduating in December of 2013. Upon receiving his Associates Degree from Nassau Community, Joshua hopes to transfer to an Ivy League school to study political science.</p>
<p><br /> Joshua&rsquo;s dedication to community service began before he ran for the school board. Joshua is the Founder and C.E.O. of Safe Ride Syosset, Inc., a community outreach program dedicated to ensuring that no Syosset teenager gets behind the wheel of a car while intoxicated, or is the passenger in a car with a drunk driver (SafeRideSyosset.org). Joshua and his volunteers safely drove home over 350 students in 2012, and he is currently working to bring his Safe Ride program to many high schools across Long Island. Joshua continues to make volunteerism and community service a priority in his life. Joshua is a member of the Board of Directors of the Long Island Council on Alcoholism and Drug Dependence (LICADD), whose mission is to aid both families and individuals who suffer from alcoholism and drug addiction. Joshua is a member of both the Nassau County Heroin Prevention Task Force as well as the Long Island Youth Safety Coalition, helping to bring the perspective of youth into policy conversations across Long Island. After being appointed by the Nassau County Executive, Joshua was confirmed by the Nassau County Legislature as a member of the Board of Directors of the Nassau County Youth Board, a government agency that oversees funding for youth programs. Joshua is currently a volunteer firefighter in the Syosset Volunteer Fire Department. Additionally, since 2010 Joshua has volunteered several weeks each summer at Sunrise Day Camp, the only day camp in the United States dedicated exclusively for children with cancer and their siblings. Joshua has worked in both the private and public sector since his sophomore year in high school. Joshua interned at Morgan Stanley Smith Barney, worked for the Nassau County Executive's Office and most recently for the Office of the United States Surgeon General. Joshua is a Nassau County certified basketball official and a Red Cross certified life guard in addition to coaching and refereeing in the Syosset Basketball League. In 2012 Joshua was named to the Long Island Press's Power List of the 50 Most Influential People on Long Island, and was named by Red Alert Politics as one of their 30 Under 30 in their national list. Upon completing his service on the School Board, Joshua next intends to seek higher office in New York State government.</p>
